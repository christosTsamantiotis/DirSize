Task in order to test skills with the following requirements:

Write the coding solution to the following problem:

Disk Statistics
Write a console application to walk all the files and the folders inside a given directory and print their respective sizes. The application should be able to get as an input the directory where to search for the files and folders.
The app should use threads to make possible parallel processing.
The application should have a regulated output in console and to be formatted for each folder, e.g. 
The application should be able to scan entirely cosmputer disk:

“Folder stats are found: path='%s', size=%,d”

Or anything like this formatted approach.

Preferrable technologies used: Java, but you can use other programming languages if you feel more comfortable. 


*****************	R E A D M E	   **********************************

In order to fully scan any disk you need root or admin access. Otherwise exception errors are shown with inaccessible directories. I used Java so I cannot get direct admin access from the code itself. 
Real simple program done in a short amount of time.
